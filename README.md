### About
Dashboard was designed to provide the business-oriented client with a one-stop location for important information on weather, stocks, cryptocurrency, news, and location information.

### Login

Users may login by entering their email address and password on the login page. New users may create an account by entering their desired credentials, then clicking the hyperlink indicated at the bottom of the page. **This avoids the need for a separate create-an-account page**

### Weather

Upon accessing the news page, the user will be presented with cards reflecting the 20 top headlines (as decided by the New York Times API). To view news articles on a specific topic, the user may enter a topic in the search bar. Upon pressing Enter, ten articles will appear relating to the searched topic and two new buttons will appear under the search bar - these buttons will allow the user to page through the results returned from the New York Times.

### Maps

With the business-oriented client in mind, the Maps page was implemented to allow users to visualize the location of his/her/their next business meeting. Upon entering a city, place, or address into the search bar and pressing enter, the user will be presented with a list of relevant options as determined by Google. Upon selecting an option, the user will be able to locate the city/place/address on a map.
